# Embedded System Codes

This repository contains codes for interfacing various sensors using an Arduino development board.

## Capstone Project - Smart Security System

The setup used for the project is as shown in the figure.

The purpose of this project was to develop a smart security system for secured gates or vaults. The user is allowed to unlock the gate by sending the correct password via bluetooth. In case any object comes too close to the gate before the correct password is uploaded, an alarm comprising a buzzer and an LED is activated. If the correct password is uploaded, the sonar stops scanning for obstacles for a time sufficient for the user to enter and then begins to scan for intruders again.
